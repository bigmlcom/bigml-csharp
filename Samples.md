You can view some code examples in the Gists folder or in these links below:

### Calculate score with a know anomaly
In this gist show how to retrieve an anomaly detector previously created in BigML (retrievement is very similar for every kind of resources) and creates an score for a set of data.

See code [here](Gists/ScoreAfterRetrieveAnomaly.cs).

### Predict with an Iris ensemble
A very simple example of how to create a prediction with an ensemble (for model is close to be equal) that
you previously created. In this example the ensemble resource is not retrieved.

See code [here](Gists/PredictionWithIrisEnsemble.cs).
