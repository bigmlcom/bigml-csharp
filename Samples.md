Examples / Gists
-----------------

You can view some code examples in the Gists folder or in these links below:

### Calculate score with a know anomaly
Example of how to retrieve a previously created anomaly detector
(retrieval is very similar for all resources) and to create an score for
new data set.

See code [here](Gists/ScoreAfterRetrieveAnomaly.cs).

### Predict with an Iris ensemble
A very simple example of how to create a prediction with an ensemble
that you previously created (also similar to creating a prediction from
an existing model). In this example the ensemble resource is not retrieved.

See code [here](Gists/PredictionWithIrisEnsemble.cs).

### Train a Model from public data hosted in Azure
Example of how to upload data from a public file in Azure to create a `Source`,
a `Dataset` and finally a `Model` from it.

See code [here](Gists/ModelFromAzureSource.cs).

### Train a Cluster from public data hosted in Azure
Example of how to upload data from a public file in Azure to create a `Source`,
a `Dataset` and finally a `Cluster` from it.

See code [here](Gists/ClusterFromAzureSource.cs).
